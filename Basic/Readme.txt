/* How Node.js is different from vanilla js */
//1)Node runs on a server - not in a browser (backed not frontend)
//2)The console is the terminal window
//3)global object instead of window object
//console.log(global)
//4)Has common core modules that we will explore
//5)CommonJS modules instead of ES6 modules
//6)Missing some JS APISs like fetch
